# Introduction


I just Finish 2015 IEEE Signal Processing Cup, and here is an Heart Rate Tracking algorithm using Wrist-Typed PPG Signal.


**Notice**
> This is **Not** the exact algorithm we used in the paper: [http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~tke/doc/MICROST.pdf](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~tke/doc/MICROST.pdf), which gave  better result than this one, but the idea and procedure are the same.

<br>

## How to Run

1. Download the code
2. Add Path in Matlab
3. change variable in init.m (where to save pictures)

Then

```matlab
runall_train %% run algorithm on all training data
runall_test  %% run algorithm on all testing data
```

You will see the result.

## About the algorithm   

- 7-order haar wavelet transform for signal preprocess
- Four Heuristic Unit for tracking Frequency Peak
    - **Memory Rule**: for heart rate could not change too sharply
    - **Magnitude Rule**: select the larger peak
    - **Wavelet Rule**(only used in the first frame): 
            When the heart rate peak submerges in motion peaks, the wavelet preprocess may make it emerges.
          
    - **Acceleration Rule**: When the subject speeds up, the heart rate tends to grow


And each rule corresponds to a M-file.
